# XamarinMobileTest
Xamarin Mobile C# MVVM Shell Project
=========

###Purpose:
Life developing Microsoft .NET WPF apps is exciting yet there is something refreshing about being able to have your hot new app run on more platforms. This sample or shell project is my effort to both refresh my Xamarin skills as well as provide a base for future Mono based mobile apps. 

###Features:
- Implements common MVVM pattern
- Views are structured such that only XAML be changed (code behind files can be safely ignorred)
- ViewModels by default inherit an implementation of INotifyPropertyChanged
- DelegateCommand class provides a wrapper for passing in methods to views
